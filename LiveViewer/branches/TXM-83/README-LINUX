Linux Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these instructions for a quick start to building this project. If any 
of the dependenices need to be built, see their respective sections below.

-) Make certain Qt is properly installed on your system. LiveViewer is 
   currently developed using Qt 4.8.0. Check that that Qt bin directory is 
   added to the system path, and that the Qt lib directory is added to 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

-) Make certain EPICS is properly installed on your system. LiveViewer is 
   currently developed using EPICS base 3.14.12.2. Modify the EPICS_BASE,
   EPICS_HOST_ARCH and EPICS_TARGET_OS qmake variables in LiveViewer.pro 
   file to reflect the EPICS install location and respective platform. 
   Check that the environment variables are set to reflect the EPICS 
   install used. On Linux, EPICS_TARGET_OS should be set to "Linux".

-) Make certain the boost library is installed on your system. LiveViewer is
   currently developed using boost-1.49.0. Modify the BOOST_INCLUDE and 
   BOOST_LIBS qmake variables in LiveViewer.pro to reflect the boost 
   install location for your platform.

-) Make certain GStar is installed on your system. Modify the GSTAR_INCLUDE and
   GSTAR_LIBS qmake variables in LiveViewer.pro to reflect the GStar install
   location for you platform.

-) In the LiveViewer root directoy type the following:
      $> qmake
      $> make

-) This should build the executable in bin.

-) Enjoy!

64-bit / Static Qt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Build Qt-static-x64 ---

-) This project is currently developed using Qt-4.8.0. Download 
   'qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.0.tar.gz' from Qt's ftp site. 
   Uncompress and extract it somewhere nice.

-) Open a command prompt. Change to the 
   'qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.0' directory and type the following to 
   configure the Qt build, build it and install it:
      > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Qt-4.8-static-x64 -release -static 
        -no-accessibility -no-sql-db2 -no-sql-ibase -no-sql-mysql -no-sql-oci 
        -no-sql-odbc -no-sql-psql -no-sql-sqlite -no-sql-sqlite2 
        -no-sql-sqlite_symbian -no-sql-tds -no-qt3support -no-multimedia 
        -no-audio-backend -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-svg -no-webkit 
        -no-javascript-jit -no-declarative -no-declarative-debug -no-gif 
        -no-libtiff -no-libmng -no-libjpeg -no-openssl -no-nas-sound 
        -no-opengl -no-openvg
      > make
      > make install

-) Edit the system path environment variable to contain the newly created
   '/usr/local/Qt-4.8-static-x64/bin' directory.

--- Build boost ---

-) This project is dependent upon the boost library. It is currently developed
   using boost_1_49_0. Download it and put it somewhere nice.

-) Open a command prompt, change to the boost directory, and 
   type the following:
      > ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/installation/prefix
      > ./b2 install

--- Build GStar ---

-) This project is dependent upon the GStar library. Download it and put it
   somewhere nice.

-) Open a command prompt.
   Change directory to the GStar root directory and build it with
      > qmake
      > make

-) See the GStar README file for futher instructions.

--- Build EPICS ---

-) Download EPICS base and put it somewhere nice.

-) Set the EPICS_TARGET_OS environment variable to 'Linux'.

-) Set the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable to 'linux-x86_64'.

-) Follow the EPICS instructions for building.

-) Set the EPICS_BASE environment variable.

-) Set the EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES environment variable to something large
   like '5000000'.

--- Build ScanOcean - LiverViewer Prototype ---

-) Open a Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt.
   Change directory to the LiveViewer root directory. Edit LiveViewer.pro and
   modify the following:

   BOOST_INCLUDE = "Location of boost include files."
   BOOST_LIBS = "Location of boost library files."
   EPICS_BASE = "Location of EPICS base."
   EPICS_TARGET_OS = "Linux"
   EPICS_HOST_ARCH = "linux-x86_64"
   GSTAR_INCLUDE = "Location of GStar include files."
   GSTAR_LIBS = "Location of GStar library file."

-) In the LiveViewer root directoy type the following:
      $> qmake
      $> make

-) This should build the executable in bin.

-) Enjoy!
