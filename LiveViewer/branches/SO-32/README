-) Make certain Qt is properly installed on your system. LiveViewer is 
   currently developed using Qt 4.8.0. Check that that Qt bin directory is 
   added to the system path. On UNIX variants, the Qt lib directory should be 
   added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

-) Make certain EPICS is properly installed on your system. LiveViewer is 
   currently developed using EPICS base 3.14.12.2. Modify the EPICS_BASE and
   EPICS_HOST_ARCH qmake variables in LiveViewer.pro file to reflect the EPICS 
   install location and respective platform. Check that the environment 
   variables are set to reflect the EPICS install used.   

-) Make certain the boost library is installed on your system. LiveViewer is
   currently developed using boost-1.49.0. Modify the BOOST_INCLUDE and 
   BOOST_LIBS qmake variables in LiveViewer.pro to reflect the boost 
   install location for your platform.

-) In the LiveViewer root directoy type the following:
      $> qmake
      $> make

-) This should build the executable in bin.

-) Enjoy!
