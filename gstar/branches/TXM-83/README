Basic Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-) Make certain Qt is properly installed on your system. GStar is currently
   developed using Qt 4.8.0. Check that the Qt bin directory is added to the
   system path. On UNIX variants, the Qt lib directory should be added to
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

-) If the Qt version above is built as shared libraries, GStar must be compiled
   as a shared library. Do so by editing GStar.pro so that the CONFIG line
   does NOT have 'staticlib' on it. If the Qt version above is biult as static
   libraries, GStar must be compiled as a static library. Do so by editing
   GStar.pro so that the CONFIG Line does have 'staticlib' on it.

-) In the XPCSUI root directoy type the following:
      $> qmake
      $> make

-) This should build the executable in bin.

-) Enjoy!
